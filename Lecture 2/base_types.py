# Grundl√§ggande datatyper
# int, integers are whole numbers
# float, floating point numbers, are numbers with decimals
# str, strings, are strings of text
# bool, booleans, binary operator which is either T or F, on or off
# none, equal to null

print(f"Integer{My_little_integer} - Type: {type(My_little_integer)}")
# Prints a formated string that inputs the variable name to output its values
# type() returns the data type of the content
# When dividing ints, the retun will be float
# Because division can result in floats, all results willl be floats
# Operations with floats will always lead to floats
# If there is a possibility for the result to be float, it wil always be float
